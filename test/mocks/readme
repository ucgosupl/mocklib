This is unit test of mocks

Folders:
src - production code - contains header file to be mocked
test - unit tests
utils - helper functions
mock_manual - mocks created manually using mocklib
mock_define - mocks created using defines
mock_generated - mocks generated by script

The same unit tests should be passed by all three mock implementations.
